# Library for working with matrix

- **matrix-tools** - contains convenient naming of classes and functionality for working with matrices like:
  - `function print` -- printing set of matrices a.
  - `function gen_matrices` - generition matrices N by N over set of numbers num.
  - `function equivalent_subgraphs_2_by_2` - checking two sets of matrices 2 by 2 to be equivalent
  - `function is_additionable_K4` - finding all matrices expanding the clique
  - `function expand` - finding number of ways to add a matrix to clique K5 to get K11112
  - `function is_standard_automorphism` - checking that automorphism is standard
